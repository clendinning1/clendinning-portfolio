    1. Use good elements, classes, and ids. Divs are okay but don't overuse them.
    -->

    <!--Header (intro card). everything else is hidden until clicking "expand".-->
    <header>
        <h1>clendinning.</h1>
        <header class="exp">expand</header>

    <!--Should all three cards be under one element, or to each their own? maybe to each their own, since "body" covers everything that overlaps????????????
        No, I think each card should be an id under each element, since they have to be linked to.

    <!--Content (cards 1-3).-->

        <!--About ID (first card). contains a short "about me" with two buttons for "work" and "contact".-->

        <!--Contact ID (third card). this is my contact info. when the button is clicked, it should appear underneath the "about"(??)-->
